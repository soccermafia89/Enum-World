    //Will only apply filters when deemed necessary
    //Will avoid splits at all costs
    //Will use a set of input rules to create new filters on the fly
    //Will use the query engine to determine how to generate new filters on the fly.
    
    //Will require minor rework of partitions
    
    //(Possibly?) Will use 'lazy' implementation.  Only perform splits when queries demand it.
